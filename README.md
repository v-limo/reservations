# Reservation API

The API is designed to manage book reservations, providing an endpoint for all CRUD operations and additional endpoints
to manage reservations and reservation history. The API is built with .NET 8 (the fastest and greatest ASP.NET
core [yet](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-asp-net-core-in-dotnet-8/#:~:text=the%20fastest%20release-,yet,-!%20Compared%20to%20.NET)),
Entity Framework and SQlite with Unit test with Xunit. Some of the keywords and terms associated with this design are
swagger UI, Moq, SQlite, Fluent Validation, Unit, Xunit, Docker, docker-compose, RESTful API, Testing, API
documentation, Container orchestration with kubernetes etc.

## Features

- GET    `api/v1/books`      - Get all books
- GET    `api/v1/books/{bookId}` - Get a book by id
